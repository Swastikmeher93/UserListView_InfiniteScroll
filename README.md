# flutter_bloc_api

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A Flutter application that fetches and displays user data, posts, and todos from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com). The app features an infinite-scroll user list with circular avatars and a user details screen with posts and todos in a grid layout, built using the **Flutter BLoC** pattern and **Clean Architecture** for scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Infinite Scroll User List**: Lazy-loaded user list with pagination.
- **Circular Avatars**: Displays user avatars fetched from the API.
- **User Details Screen**: Shows user info (name, email, etc.) with posts and todos in a 2-column grid.
- **Responsive UI**: Card-based grid for posts/todos with loading and error states.
- **Clean Architecture**: Separates presentation, domain, and data layers.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses `get_it` for modular dependency management.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized exception handling for API errors.

## Setup Instructions

- **Dart**: Included with Flutter.
- **IDE**: Android Studio, VS Code, or similar with Flutter plugins.
- **Emulator/Device**: Android/iOS emulator or physical device.
- **Git**: Installed for cloning the repository.
- **Internet**: Required for API calls.
